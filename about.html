  <h1>About TaskEarn</h1>

  <p>
    TaskEarn is a demo task-based platform created for learning and testing purposes.
    Our goal is to build a simple and user-friendly system where users can explore
    task-based reward concepts.
  </p>

  <p>
    Currently, TaskEarn is in demo / coming soon stage. No real earnings or payments
    are guaranteed at this time.
  </p>

  <p>
    In the future, we plan to introduce verified tasks, partnerships, and transparent
    reward systems while following all legal and platform guidelines.
  </p>

  <p>
    We believe in transparency, user trust, and continuous improvement.
